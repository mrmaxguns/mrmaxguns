Hello, I'm Maxim. Most of the coding work I've done on my own time can be
found right here on GitHub. I enjoy learning new things and applying my
knowledge with projects. I started coding in fourth grade -- it all started
with Scratch. Know I know much more, but I am still in a constant state of
learning.
